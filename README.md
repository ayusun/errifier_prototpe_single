errifier
========

A error Notifying application that makes error discovery faster

Why errifier
============

errifier was made with the idea to make the error discovery faster. That means, to get notified about the error as soon as it occurs. Without actually constantly looking at the logs, waiting for the error to occur, or to wait for someone else to tell you that "this particular thing isn't working", in which case again you will look at the logs to know what actually happened.

errifier makes your job easy, by looking for errors and then by notifying you about it, when it occurs; and in the mean time you can actually work on what ever useful thing you were working on.

Let the error occur when it has to occur
